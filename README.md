Description of the Interactive Shop Code
The code implements an interactive e-commerce application designed to provide a seamless user experience for both customers and the shop owner. The structure of the application is divided into two main interfaces:

User Interface
1. Catalog Navigation: Users can explore a wide range of products through an intuitive interface that displays detailed information such as name, description, price, and availability.

2. Add to Cart: Users can select desired products and add them to their cart. The application manages available quantities and dynamically updates the cart.

3. Cart and Checkout: Users can view their cart, modify quantities, or remove items. The checkout process is straightforward, guiding the user through order confirmation and payment information entry.

4. Feedback and Notifications: Users receive immediate feedback for actions taken, such as adding items to the cart or completing a purchase, enhancing interactivity and engagement.

Shop Owner Interface
1. Catalog Management: The owner can add, modify, or remove products from the catalog, managing details such as description, price, and available quantity. This functionality allows for complete control over inventory.

2. Sales Monitoring: The interface provides detailed sales statistics, enabling the owner to analyze product performance and make informed inventory management decisions.![tab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6a2b1e6-1cac-4d18-a598-c77a9cbc687f)
